## Overview
**ChessOnlineAlfarnedo** is the result of a Master Thesis Project, to develop a web application, as a tutor for the training of certain chess endings, which helps to improve the skills and enhance the capabilities of all types of chess players. 

To achieve this goal, it implements a set of technologies, such as frameworks, in this case Flask, as well as the adoption of the MySQL database and the latest version of the Stockfish-13 chess engine, which presents a high level of ELO and score and introduces the UCI protocol (Universal Chess Interface) that facilitates its use and access, and PGN (Portable Game Notation) and FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) formats with which, respectively, the moves made during the game are collected and the state of the board is known at each moment of the game. 

The Stockfish complete source code is located at the following link: https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish 

To carry out this project different books, open codes and tutorials of both GitHub and forums and videos were used, whose links are the following:
